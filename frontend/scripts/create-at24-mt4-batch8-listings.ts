// scripts/create-at24-mt4-batch8-listings.ts
// AT24 education tools for MetaTrader 4 (licensed non-trading utility EAs), 11 USD each. Usage:
//   npx tsx scripts/create-at24-mt4-batch8-listings.ts            -> creates/updates the listings as DRAFT (not visible)
//   npx tsx scripts/create-at24-mt4-batch8-listings.ts --publish  -> also sets publicationState PUBLISHED
//
// MT4 does not allow WebRequest inside indicators, so each product is an Expert Advisor that only draws.
// It carries the standard AT24 licence gate: tradingSystemId doubles as the gate's product id
// (AT24-PIVOT-LEVELS-MAP-MT4 / AT24-HOURLY-RANGE-HEATMAP-MT4), so an MT5 key never opens an MT4 build.
// No Trust State; the descriptions state what was and was not verified.

const FOOTER = `\n\nEducation tool, not a signal: it draws levels and shows context, it never places orders and gives no buy or sell advice. It uses no DLL. Personal use on your own charts. Past averages and past price behaviour do not predict future price. Trading leveraged products is risky.\n\nLICENCE KEY: the download is protected by your AT24 licence key. One key works on ONE trading account at a time and only for this product; you can move it to another account yourself (2 changes per 30 days) from Dashboard > Purchases. After buying, paste the key from your purchase page into the EA input "InpLicenseKey" and allow https://www.algotraders24.ai under Tools > Options > Expert Advisors > Allow WebRequest. The Strategy Tester needs no key.`;

    "description": "Setup Pro for MetaTrader 4 marks chart setups with levels drawn before the trade and grades each setup type on your own history.\n\nMost setup indicators draw arrows and stop there. Setup Pro also tells you how each kind of setup has actually done on the symbol you are looking at - including when the answer is 'no edge'.\n\nWhat you get\n- Two setup types drawn on closed bars with entry, stop and target levels shown before the trade, so nothing repaints.\n- A trend panel for four timeframes that shows whether they agree or are mixed.\n- A scorecard per setup type: number of setups, hit rate, average R after cost, and a luck test. The verdict only says positive or negative when the result is beyond luck, and shows TOO FEW under 30 setups.\n- Optional alerts on a new setup. It never places orders. Dashboard is off in the Strategy Tester by default.\n\nWhat was verified: compiles with 0 errors and 0 warnings in MetaEditor 4 and runs on an MT4 Exness demo terminal on XAUUSD (last 8,000 bars: first setup type 217 setups with an average of -0.03 R after cost, second 124 setups with -0.08 R, both NO EDGE SHOWN - see the screenshot). The scorecard layer matches an independent Python calculation (343 setups and their scores, all identical) in the MetaTrader 5 edition. These are hindsight statistics on past bars: past results on this symbol do not predict future results, and nothing here shows an edge.\nNot verified: live-money use, other symbols and brokers, the licence check with a real purchase on MT4. It is delivered as a non-trading utility Expert Advisor (MT4 does not allow licence checks inside indicators). MetaTrader 4 only.\n\nEducation tool, not a signal: it draws levels and shows context, it never places orders and gives no buy or sell advice. It uses no DLL. Personal use on your own charts. Past averages and past price behaviour do not predict the future."
