    description: `AT24 FVG Zones for TradingView finds every three-bar fair value gap on closed bars, draws the ones still open, and measures on the chart you are looking at how often and how fast price really came back to a gap compared with a control level (Pine Script).

What you get
- Bullish and bearish gap zones, size-filtered by ATR (an input), only the open ones drawn, touched gaps labelled.
- A dashboard table: the number of open gaps, the nearest open gap above and below price, gaps measured, how often price came back within 50 bars and how fast, how often it filled the gap completely, and the same for a control level at the same distance.
- TradingView uses all the bars loaded on your chart, so counts differ from the MetaTrader 5 edition by timeframe and history.

What was verified: the script compiles and renders in TradingView's Pine Editor (OANDA XAUUSD 1h, 1,070 gaps: revisited within 50 bars 87% with a median of 2 bars, filled completely 75%, control level revisited 89% - see the screenshot). These numbers are historical and descriptive and show no edge: a gap is no stronger a magnet than any other level at that distance.
Not verified: live-money use, other symbols and exchanges. ${TV_LICENCE_NOTE}${FOOT}`,
